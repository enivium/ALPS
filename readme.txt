This is the MATLAB code for the Artemis Lander Power Simulation (ALPS). The 
simulation scripts should be run in MATLAB in the directory they are locaed in.

The rainflow algorithm in the src/rainflow directory was written by Adam Nieslony. It is included
here for completeness and is available for download at the link in the following citation:
